# Nameite-
Nameite is a game finance project,  created with purpose of fun and wealth creation.
Nameite is a web3 gaming platform that will redefine the entire concept of gaming as we know 
it, by creating a community inclusive decisions making process with regards to gaming modifications, we 
achieve this through the following:
● Low cost of transaction: Nameite will be built on Algorand blockchain and utilizes its low cost of 
transaction and transaction speed. This will completely eliminate high transaction fee as 
experienced on ethereum network.
● Ease of entry: Players can create game character based on individual preference. Players can 
start from scratch and build game character or buy character attributes in form of nft’s, this 
ensures players of all class and ability can play thereby eliminating unnecessary barrier to entry.
● Game duration: Nameite intends to create lucrative and addictive game model, but a player can 
stop playing at any given time, sell off acquired nft in a permission less fashion.
● Governance: This allows players to vote for or against new features of a game, this ensures 
game models are tailored to suit the needs of players. 
● Token Value: a single token ticker will be used during in game purchases, ensuring the value is 
stable as per market price during sale while nft’s can be sold in Nameite token or Algorand and 
still maintain market valuation.
